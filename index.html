    <h1>Caring for Casey and Katie's Home</h1>
    <h2>Leon</h2>
    <h5>By Far the Most Important as Leon Rocks!</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Leon Requires Lots of Love. He loves pets and scritches, sitting
      on your lap and only gives "love nips" after extended petting (cat people
      know this, he doesn't bite). His Brush is in the pantry, mouse-shaped
      laser pointer and toys are around kitchen bar and living room. He is a
      longtime Family Member (that doesn't pay rent) so please love him like I
      do! </li>
      <li>Feed Twice a Day and Fill Water Once a Day. Food is Semi-Moist
      <em>Pet Fresh</em> brand food located on bottom shelf of refrigerator
      door. Money provided to purchase more at any major grocery store in the
      refrigerator in the pet aisle (we go to Target).</li>
      <li>Scoop Litter Once a Day. Dump and Refill with new Liner if/when gets
      smelly.</li>
      <li>Food and Litter Disposal: Use Plastic Grocery Bags (stored in
      small cabinets above stove) and Leave Outside of Front Door until ready
      to Take Down to Dumpsters to right of Condo stairs. This Prevents
      Smell</li>
      <li>Leon Barfs 2-3 times a week. Vet says he is healthy and barfing is
      Stomach Acid Reflux due to eating habits. Best Way to Prevent barfs is to
      feed on Regular Schedule. If he isn't eating the food he will not eat it
      and you need to refill it from the same or new bag. He is Picky but I love
      him and he gets fresh semi-moist food that will fill his belly. </li>
      <li>Cleaning Barfs: If on tile, water and paper towel makes it easy. If on
      carpet, use wet vaccum in guest bathroom closet along with water bottle in
      cabinet above toaster (water dispenser on wet vac is broken). Add a little
      Bissel carpet cleaning solution to water bottle (Need Only Use small
      amount, located beneath sink), shake and soak affected area. Turn on Both
      Switches on Wet Vac, wait for red light to come on and vaccum area. Repeat
      as necessary (I usually do it twice for good measure). If he barfs behind
      the couch, forget it and we'll clean it once home.</li>
